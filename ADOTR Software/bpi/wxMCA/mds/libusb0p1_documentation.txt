Documentation   
Authors:  Xiaofan Chen
The following documentation is based on libusb-0.1 API documentation (http://libusb.sourceforge.net/doc/) by Johannes Erdfelt, but added with libusb-win32 specific information.

Preface 
The purpose of this document is to explain the libusb-win32 API and how to use it to make a USB aware application. Any suggestions, corrections and comments regarding this document should be sent to the libusb-win32 developers mailing list.

I. Introduction

This documentation will provide an overview of how the v0.1 libusb API works and relates to USB. It is assumed that the reader has a good understanding of the USB 2.0 specification. The USB 2.0 specification can be found the USB Implementers Forum website (http://www.usb.org). libusb-0.1 works under Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD; Darwin/MacOS X and Solaris. libusb-win32 is API compatible with libusb-0.1 but also includes some new features.

II. API

This is the external API for applications to use. The API is relatively lean and designed to closely correspond with the USB 2.0 specification.

Devices and interfaces

The libusb API ties an open device to a specific interface. This means that if you want to claim multiple interfaces on a device, you should open the device multiple times to receive one usb_dev_handle for each interface you want to communicate with. Don't forget to call usb_claim_interface().

Timeouts in libusb are always specified in milliseconds.

libusb uses both abstracted and non abstracted structures to maintain portability.

All functions in the original libusb v0.1 are synchronous, meaning the functions block and wait for the operation to finish or timeout before returning execution to the calling application. libusb-win32 adds some asynchronous APIs. libusb-1.0 has more asynchronous API support.

There are two types of return values used in libusb v0.1. The first is a handle returned by usb_open(). The second is an int. In all cases where an int is returned, >= 0 is a success and < 0 is an error condition.

Timeout
The unit for timeout value is ms.

Under Linux libusb-0.1 (which only supports synchronous API), timeout value of 0 means infinite. libusb-win32 version 1.2.4.7 and later will follow this for synchronous API. Before that, it behaves differently from Linux libusb-0.1.

Since Windows (same for Linux and Mac OS X) is not an RTOS, it is not a good idea to use small timeout value like 10ms or 100ms.

Caveats of synchronous transfer when timeout happens
How synchronous API works:
1) Submits read request to driver
2) Waits the specified timeout using WaitForSingleObject()
a. if a wait timeout occurred, send abort pipe request and return -116
b. if wait succeeded, get transfer results via GetOverlappedResults() and return error or transfer length.

So, if a transfer completes just after a timeout is detected in 2a, the entire transfer is lost.

There are currently a couple ways to avoid this:
1) Use the async transfer functions and usb_reap_async_nocancel()
2) Use the sync transfer functions from within their own thread and
always use INFINITE for the timeout.

usb_find_devices()
Name
usb_find_devices -- Find all devices on all USB devices
Description
int usb_find_devices(void);

Description
struct usb_bus *usb_get_busses(void);

usb_get_busses() simply returns the value of the global variable usb_busses. This was implemented for those languages that support C calling convention and can use shared libraries, but don't support C global variables (like Delphi).

usb_set_debug()
Name
usb_set_debug -- set debug message verbose level
Description
void usb_set_debug(int level);

usb_set_debug() sets the debug message verbose level. You can set it to 4 to print the debug message which is quite verbose.
 0  LOG_OFF,
 1  LOG_ERROR,
 2  LOG_WARNING,
 3  LOG_INFO,
 4  LOG_DEBUG
2. Device operations

This group of functions deal with the device. It allows you to open and close the device as well standard USB operations like setting the configuration, alternate settings, clearing halts and resetting the device. It also provides OS level operations such as claiming and releasing 
interfaces.

usb_open()
Name
usb_open -- Opens a USB device
Description
usb_dev_handle *usb_open(struct *usb_device dev);

usb_open() is to be used to open up a device for use. usb_open must be called before attempting to perform any operations to the device. Returns a handle used in future communication with the device.

usb_close()
Name
usb_close -- Closes a USB device
Description
int usb_close(usb_dev_handle *dev);

usb_close closes a device opened with usb_open. No further operations may be performed on the handle after usb_close is called. Returns 0 on success or < 0 on error.

usb_set_configuration()
Name
usb_set_configuration -- Sets the active configuration of a device
Description
int usb_set_configuration(usb_dev_handle *dev, int configuration);

usb_set_configuration sets the active configuration of a device. The configuration parameter is the value as specified in the descriptor field bConfigurationValue. Returns 0 on success or < 0 on error.

    '''Must be called'''!: usb_set_configuration must be called with a valid configuration (not 0) before you can claim the interface. This might not be necessary in the future. This behavior is different from Linux libusb-0.1.

    '''Deprecated''': usb_resetep is deprecated. You probably want to use usb_clear_halt.

usb_clear_halt()
Name
usb_clear_halt -- Clears any halt status on an endpoint
Description
int usb_clear_halt(usb_dev_handle *dev, unsigned int ep);

Description
int usb_reset(usb_dev_handle *dev);
usb_reset() resets the specified device by sending a RESET down the port it is connected to. Returns 0 on success or < 0 on error.

    '''Causes re-enumeration''': After calling usb_reset, the device will need to re-enumerate and thus requires you to find the new device and open a new handle. The handle used to call usb_reset() will no longer work.

usb_claim_interface()
Name
usb_claim_interface -- Claim an interface of a device
Description
int usb_claim_interface(usb_dev_handle *dev, int interface);

usb_claim_interface() claims the interface with the Operating System. The interface parameter is the value as specified in the descriptor field bInterfaceNumber. Returns 0 on success or < 0 on error.
    '''Must be called'''!: usb_claim_interface must be called before you perform any operations related to this interface (like usb_set_altinterface, usb_bulk_write, etc).

6. Asynchronous API and Isochronous Transfer

'''Windows Specific'''

libusb-win32 supports Isochronous Transfer through its Asynchronous API. The libusb-win32 Asynchronous API also supports the other transfer types like Control Transfer, Interrupt Transfer and Bulk Transfer.

int usb_isochronous_setup_async(usb_dev_handle *dev, void **context, unsigned char ep, int pktsize);

   Allocates an asynchonous request for endpoint 'ep' and returns that request in 'context'.
   Returns 0 on success, < 0 on failure.

int usb_bulk_setup_async(usb_dev_handle *dev, void **context, unsigned char ep);

   Allocates an asynchonous request for endpoint 'ep' and returns that request in 'context'.
   Returns 0 on success, < 0 on failure.

int usb_interrupt_setup_async(usb_dev_handle *dev, void **context, unsigned char ep);

   Allocates an asynchonous request for endpoint 'ep' and returns that request in 'context'.
   Returns 0 on success, < 0 on failure.

int usb_submit_async(void *context, char *bytes, int size);

   Submits a previously allocated request to the device. Data pointed to by 'bytes' of size 'size' will be written or read to or from the device depending on the endpoint's direction bit. 
   Returns 0 on success, < 0 on failure.

int usb_reap_async(void *context, int timeout);

   Waits for the request to finish. Returns the number of bytes written/read or < 0 on failure.
   The request will be canceled if it doesn't complete within 'timeout' (in ms).

int usb_reap_async_nocancel(void *context, int timeout);

   Same as usb_reap_async() but doesn't cancel the request if it times out. Therefore you can try to reap it later.

int usb_cancel_async(void *context);

   Cancels a request.

int usb_free_async(void **context);

   Frees a request.

* Usage:

 char data[1024];
 void *request;
 int read;
 if(usb_bulk_setup_async(dev, &request, 0x81) < 0) {
   // error handling
 }
 if(usb_submit_async(request, data, sizeof(data)) < 0) {
   // error handling
 }
 read =  usb_reap_async(request, 1000);
 if(read >= 0)
 printf("read %d bytes\n", read);
 else
   // error handling
 usb_free_async(&request);
7. Non Portable

These functions are non portable. They may expose some part of the USB API on one OS or perhaps more, but not all. They are all marked with the string _np at the end of the function name.

A C preprocessor macro will be defined if the function is implemented. The form is LIBUSB_HAS_ prepended to the function name, without the leading "usb_", in all caps. For example, if usb_get_driver_np is implemented, LIBUSB_HAS_GET_DRIVER_NP will be defined.

*Linux Specific*

usb_get_driver_np()
Name
usb_get_driver_np -- Get driver name bound to interface
Description
int usb_get_driver_np(usb_dev_handle *dev, int interface, char *name, int namelen);

This function will obtain the name of the driver bound to the interface specified by the parameter interface and place it into the buffer named name limited to namelen characters. Returns 0 on success or < 0 on error. Implemented on Linux only.

usb_detach_kernel_driver_np()
Name
usb_detach_kernel_driver_np -- Detach kernel driver from interface
Description
int usb_detach_kernel_driver_np(usb_dev_handle *dev, int interface);

This function will detach a kernel driver from the interface specified by parameter interface. Applications using libusb can then try claiming the interface. Returns 0 on success or < 0 on error. Implemented on Linux only.

*Windows Specific*

    /* Windows specific functions */

const struct usb_version *usb_get_version(void); 
    Return the library version.

The following functions are related to driver installation (device driver mode of filter driver mode). Normally you should not use them. You can bundle the GUI Inf-Wizard with your application. Or you can choose to write your own driver installation applications.
libwdi (http://libwdi.sf.net/) or WDK DIFX (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff544838%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) can be used for that purpose. You can combine libwdi/DIFx with installers like Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) or NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/).

    #define LIBUSB_HAS_INSTALL_SERVICE_NP 1
    int usb_install_service_np(void);
    void CALLBACK usb_install_service_np_rundll(HWND wnd, HINSTANCE instance, LPSTR cmd_line, int cmd_show);

    #define LIBUSB_HAS_UNINSTALL_SERVICE_NP 1
    int usb_uninstall_service_np(void);
    void CALLBACK usb_uninstall_service_np_rundll(HWND wnd, HINSTANCE instance, LPSTR cmd_line, int cmd_show);

    #define LIBUSB_HAS_INSTALL_DRIVER_NP 1
    int usb_install_driver_np(const char *inf_file);
    void CALLBACK usb_install_driver_np_rundll(HWND wnd, HINSTANCE instance, LPSTR cmd_line, int cmd_show);

    #define LIBUSB_HAS_TOUCH_INF_FILE_NP 1
    int usb_touch_inf_file_np(const char *inf_file);
    void CALLBACK usb_touch_inf_file_np_rundll(HWND wnd, HINSTANCE instance, LPSTR cmd_line, int cmd_show);

    #define LIBUSB_HAS_INSTALL_NEEDS_RESTART_NP 1
    int usb_install_needs_restart_np(void);

More details to Be Added.
IV. Examples

There are some non-intuitive parts of libusb v0.1 that aren't difficult, but are probably easier to understand with some examples.

Basic Examples

Before any communication can occur with a device, it needs to be found. This is accomplished by finding all of the busses and then finding all of the devices on all of the busses:

{{{
        struct usb_bus *busses;

        usb_init();
        usb_find_busses();
        usb_find_devices();

        busses = usb_get_busses();
}}}
After this, the application should manually loop through all of the busess and all of the devices and matching the device by whatever criteria is needed:

    struct usb_bus *bus;
    int c, i, a;

    /* ... */

    for (bus = busses; bus; bus = bus->next) {
        struct usb_device *dev;

        for (dev = bus->devices; dev; dev = dev->next) {
            /* Check if this device is a printer */
            if (dev->descriptor.bDeviceClass == 7) {
                /* Open the device, claim the interface and do your processing */
                ...
            }

            /* Loop through all of the configurations */
            for (c = 0; c < dev->descriptor.bNumConfigurations; c++) {
                /* Loop through all of the interfaces */
                for (i = 0; i < dev->config[c].bNumInterfaces; i++) {
                    /* Loop through all of the alternate settings */
                    for (a = 0; a < dev->config[c].interface[i].num_altsetting; a++) {
                        /* Check if this interface is a printer */
                        if (dev->config[c].interface[i].altsetting[a].bInterfaceClass == 7) {
                        /* Open the device, set the alternate setting, claim the interface and do your processing */
                           ...
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
